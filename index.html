      <p class="s1">Dosa</p>
      <p class="col-lg-4">
        While making paper dosa, one important tip is to
        maintain the temperature of the tawa. If the tawa
        is even slightly hot, you won't be able to spread
        the batter. If the tawa is not hot, the dosa will
        not become crisp. Thus while cooking, you need to
        maintain a medium temperature in the tawa
